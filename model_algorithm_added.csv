  One should notice here that they are focusing their study on uncoated nanoparticles, because it is important to evaluate and predict first the real ecotoxic effects of nanoparticles in their bare forms (uncoated) to gather a baseline reference. Then, future studies can be devoted to the influence of other factors such as the presence of coating agents, and light irradiation.

  A perturbation approach was applied (Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2013) to the original dataset of 229 nanoparticles/cases. To do so, 36488 pairs were randomly chosen from the 229 different nanoparticles, being in each pair one nanoparticle taken as the initial state (reference) and the other one to be predicted (new, final or output state)
  
  (see equations 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the publication)
  Molecular descriptors (coating related) were calculated from order 1 to 6, being weighted by physicochemical properties (PP) such as hydrophobicity and polar surface area. The Î¼k(PP) descriptors were calculated with the software MODELSLAB.
  Building model was applied using forward wise procedure (which will affect on the descriptors that will be available in the final model).",229.0,27347,9141,9,"Final data set, which comprises 36488 cases (NPâˆ’NP pairs), was randomly split into two series: training and prediction (validation or test) sets. The training set was employed to generate the QSTR-perturbation model, being formed by 27347 cases, 17560 of them assigned as nontoxic and 9787 toxic. The prediction (validation or test) set was used to assess the predictive power of the model. This set encompassed 9141 cases, 5880 nontoxic and 3261 toxic. It should be specifically detailed here that all the cases belonging to the prediction set were never used in the training set.
  
  Since the validation data that they have used are pairs from the already used NPs as part of other pairs, we have classified them as test set and the remaining 3 totally independent NPs of Niquel used to demonstrate the applicability of the model","Not specified in the paper.

  Here, they increase the number of data, including several number of new NPs, some of them with coatings, also there are an increase of organisms.
  
  The most interesting difference is the new descriptor related with the coatings and the increase in the amount of input data and the external used data.

  Cellular viability was assessed in A549 human lung epithelial cells exposed to NPs (24 h; 1-100 Î¼g/ml) in terms of mitochondrial function, using a commercially available assay (MTT). The basis of this assay viable cell-mediated conversion of colourless, water soluble (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide; MTT) to an insoluble formazan that can be measured spectrophotometrically (Î»=570 nm). Conversion of the formazan to MTT is dependent on NAD(P)H reductase enzymes, and hence is related to the metabolic activity of the cells.
  The mitochondrial impact of the NP panel was explored in more detail using a flow cytometry-based assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential using the fluorescent dye, DiOC6, to detect collapse of this potential. Traditionally, this test is used as an early marker of apoptosis and is conducted in parallel with a test for secondary necrosis (PI in this case). This test was conducted in a different, but equally relevant, cell type (THP-1 human monocyte-like cells) because the assay is better-suited to non-adherent cells that remain in suspension.",In vitro,Cytotoxicity,measured as cellular viability by determining the mitochondrial dehydrogenasesâ€™ activity,PLS,Partial_Least_Squares,,

In a next step they were split into two sets: the training set (T) and the validation set (V1) in a way ensured that the points from V1 were evenly distributed within the range of the toxicity of the training set compounds (T). We utilized the following pattern of splitting: T-T-V1-T-T-T-V1-T-T-T-V1-T-T. 
  (3).Finally, three additional compounds tested in Batch II and La2O3 were additionally included in the validation set (those compounds are indicated with V2).
  
  We split the data in an above discussed way because of three reasons:
  (i)to ensure that the compounds V1 are evenly distributed within the range of toxicity log (1/EC50),
  (ii)to have both experimental batches represented in the validation set, whereas only compounds from the Batch I were used for training, 
  (iii) to include to the validation set some additional compounds (V2) having toxicity not necessarily within the range of the training set (this would be impossible, if we have merged compounds from Batch I and II together and then labeled every third compound as a member of the validation set).

  High-throughput dynamic light scattering (HT-DLS, Dynapro Plate Reader, Wyatt Technology) was performed to determine the particle size and size distribution of the nanoparticles in water and the cell culture media.
  Zeta-potential measurement of the nanoparticle suspensions in water was performed using a ZetaPALS instrument (Zeta Potential Analyzer, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY). 
  Metal dissolution was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer SCIEX Elan DRCII ICP-MS)

  From Gajewicz et al., 2015 (already reported in this table)
  To verify morphology and size, one drop of a 100mg/mL solution was spotted on a formvar/carbon-coated TEM grid (EMS Diasum, Hatfield, PA) and allowed to dry. Once dried, the nanoparticles were viewed using a Philips/FEI CM200 TEM (Hillsboro, OR) at 120kV.
  
  Sphericity and circularity analysis data from TEM images were computed based on pixel count on a gray scale images
  
  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) for characterization of nanoparticle size and zeta potential (ZP) in cell culture media was done using on a Malvern Instruments Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument as described by Murdock et al., (2008)
  Calculated selected electronic properties based on small, stoichiometric clusters, reflecting all characteristics of fragments of crystal structures (surface) of particular oxides.

  Initial unit cell coordinates for the different NPs were taken from publically available crystallographic data (Table 2 of supplementary material) to be used on the calculations of the descriptors performed at the semi-empirical level of the theory with use of PM6 method in MOPAC 2009 software package.
  
  and
  
  From Gajewicz et al., 2015 (already reported in this table)
  To verify morphology and size, one drop of a 100mg/mL solution was spotted on a formvar/carbon-coated TEM grid (EMS Diasum, Hatfield, PA) and allowed to dry. Once dried, the nanoparticles were viewed using a Philips/FEI CM200 TEM (Hillsboro, OR) at 120kV.
  
  Sphericity and circularity analysis data from TEM images were computed based on pixel count on a gray scale images
  
  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) for characterization of nanoparticle size and zeta potential (ZP) in cell culture media was done using on a Malvern Instruments Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument as described by Murdock et al., (2008)

  Optimal descriptors calculated with two components SAk together with the global SMILES attributes (Nb and Ndb) are based on more information related to the molecular structure than the previous version of the descriptors on previous works. However, further increase of the detailing may leads to the overtraining (i.e. a situation when an excellent model for the training set is accompanied by a poor model for the test).

  InChI: International Chemical Identifier","International Chemical Identifier can be used as elucidation of the molecular structure for the QSPR analysis of the solubility of fullerene C60 in organic solvents.
  The statistical quality of the InChI-based model for fullerene C60 solubility is better than the quality of SMILES-based model (source publication) of this parameter.
  Majority of the correlation weights (W(Ik) have similar values for the 3 splits (either promote or decrease solubility). Some others are unstable (e.g. h5, h7), probably because of a weak influence of relevant molecular phenomenon. The conclusion is that some optmimal descriptors can therefore hint that some mechanistic interpreations for the C60 solubility exists (tendencies can be modified). 
  It should be also pointed out that for the first split of the three splits some descriptors are present (e.g. once), while for the other two not. This leads to signficant differences in between the three values. In the paper is stated that the model should describe substances must have InChI without rare (in the training set) attributes.","A.A Toropov, B.F. Rasulev, D. Leszczynska, J. Leszczynski, Chem.

  The threshold is the parameter for separation of SMILES elements into two classes: rare and not rare. We have used Threshold=1. This value indicates that Sk that takes place in the training less than 1 time should be blocked, i.e., its correlation weight should be equal to zero.
  SMILES attributes, which are absent in the training set, have no influence on the model. SMILES attributes which are absent in the training set (i.e., attributes which take place only in the validation set) are not involved in the modeling process. 
  If the correlation weight for the SMILES attribute SA in sequence of the runs of the optimization has values which all are larger than zero, then the attribute can be estimated as stable promoter of increase of the endpoint. Vice versa, if the correlationweight for the SA has in sequence of the runs of optimization values which all are smaller than zero, the attribute can be estimated as a stable promoter of decrease of the given endpoint. Finally, if a SMILES attribute in three runs of the optimization has both correlation weights: smaller and larger than zero values, one can estimate the attribute as an attribute of undefined role.","Troshin PA, Hoppe H, Renz J et al (2009) Material solubility- photovoltaic performance relationship in the design of novel fullerene derivatives for bulk heterojunction solar cells.

  One of the aims of the work was to obtain the critical descriptors to obtain the desired endpoint, which was also applied in a third analysis against experimental data with the obtained descriptors, but the obtained model was not applied in that analysis.

  - Whithin the model building, stepwise-MLR, using the statistical values of R^2 and Q^2 the best number of descriptors were screened.

The electrophoretic mobility and zeta potential (ZP) were characterized using light scattering and agarose gel electrophoresis.
  
  The composition of the protein corona around each formulation was characterized qualitatively using poly(acrylamide) gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and semiquantitatively using high-resolution label-free shotgun tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The abundance of several key adsorbed serum proteins was further confirmed by western blotting.

Based on physicochemical properties, protein properties were computed using the EMBOSS Pepstats program from their amino acid sequences.Redundant descriptors (i.e., highly correlated) were removed from the Pepstats output, and a total of 35 non-redundant descriptors were finally selected for prediction of net cell association. The final descriptors were computed averaging the physicochemical properties of the proteins weighted by the relative abundance of the corresponding protein. 
  
  Finally, the normalized physicochemical descriptors were used to form a new AP-based fingerprint.

  Due the use of physicochemical descriptors weighted by the relative abundance results, the model can be used to predict cell association of nanoparticles with protein coronas containing proteins different than those used for training the model. The only information needed by the model is the spectral counts and the primary sequence of the protein.
  
  After test the model with a data set of Ag NPs it was concluded that in those models based on fingerprints the nanoparticle core is a key factor that determines the structure and composition of the protein corona. Hence, the model will be only able to be applied onto Au NPs with ( not specific ) protein corona.","R^2 = 0.80

  Close related with previous already reported publications in this table (C. D. Walkey et al., 2014 and Liu, R. et al., 2015) with a key difference in the way of how were treated the protein corona descriptors. The two fingerprint techniques have been compared by calculating the normalized mutual information index between the partitions obtained after clustering the nanoparticles represented in terms of each fingerprint approach. Clustering results indicate that the information conveyed by both fingerprints is essentially the same. In addition, the modelling approach proposed here for gold and silver nanoparticles outperforms models based only on relative abundances in terms of applicability, size and stability.

Among the 785 proteins measured in the corona, once the proteins measured in only one NP were excluded, a further selection excluding all the proteins expressed in fewer than 10 NPs was performed. Proteins were then sorted according to decreasing number of sum of spectral counts (over all the NPs) and the first 129 were selected as the final fingerprint for the further development of the models.

D. Walkey, et al. et al., 2015 already reported in this table). The ratio mcell/mwell divided by mcells quantified the total cell association, where mcell is the total atomic gold (or silver) content associated with cells, mwell is the total atomic gold (or silver) content in well (associated with cells and free in solution) and mcells is the total mass of magnesium per sample. The related net cell association data were log transformed (log2 transformation) prior to modelling
  
  Cell association was chosen as a model biological interaction because of its relevance to inflammatory responses, biodistribution, and toxicity in vivo.
